## Hi, I'm Jeremiah Warinner 
I've been enjoying development since I first started learning how to code with a simple pong project written in Visual Basic back in 2012. Since then I have made great strides in my computer science education at The University of Houston Clear Lake. Most recently I have been enjoying learning JavaScript and the flexibility that it provides with a simple and easy to learn syntax. I am currently on the look out for a role in mobile development, ideally writing Kotlin or JavaScript. I'd especially love to work at a startup with a tightly knit team where I can make a difference. If you're hiring, lets chat!
