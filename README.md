## Hi, I'm Jeremiah Warinner 
Hi there! I'm a Computer Science major who loves diving into programming and data analysis. I get a kick out of turning complex data into useful insights. When I'm not glued to my computer, you'll probably find me out skateboarding or exploring the latest tech trends. Always excited to connect and share ideas! Let's innovate together!
